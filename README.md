sup, I make some apps/programs/scripts/programming and I'm currently learning JS. I have some intermediate C# and intermediate Python experience and next on my learning list is JS frameworks, especially Vue and Three.js. looking to collaborate on anything, really depends on what you bring to the table and what level of dumb you're willing to deal with.

shoot me an email at samuelrod202@gmail.com or a DM on Twitter @androidWG (you'll see I'm not super active there but I always get notifications)
