sup, I make some apps/programs/scripts/programming and I'm currently learning Python. I have some intermediate C# experience and next on my learning list is JS/CSS/HTML and dem frameworks. looking to collaborate on anything, really depends on what you bring to the table and what level of dumb you're willing to deal with.

shoot me an email at samuelrod202@gmail.com or a DM on Twitter @androidWG (you'll see I'm not very active there but I always get notifications)
